# Quiz 1

Please refrain from using any other resoures for this quiz. Let's really just check on what you have already learned.

To do this quiz, you'll want to [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repo to your own github.com account. From there...navigate to your `SavvyCoders` directory and `clone` it there. Note that this is just a simple MD repo, so you would not need to run `npm install` in this case.

Kindly add another 2nd level heading called 'Answers' and then just do a numbered list matching your 'answer number' with the '❓ number.'

Upon completion, `add` and `commit` and...get your changes up to github.com - hopefully you recall how to do that too.

## Answers

1. `git` is a version control system that essentially works as a little gnome that is hiding in the background and is always watching. The little `git` gnome can track all of your changes and save versions of what you are coding, and can also roll back to previous versions based on the gnome's impeccable memory.

2. `bash` is a tool that allows us to interface with our computer and give it commands. It basically lets us use text commands (bash is kind of like the dictionary of terms) to tell our machine to do something.

3. cd

4. A linter is something that finds and corrects errors in your code.

5. A `SyntaxError` means that some of your code may be improperly written (e.g., an open parenthesis, etc.) - basically like a grammatical error in your code.

7. Node package manager - it works with npmjs.com to leverage other code modules to make working on our code easier.
